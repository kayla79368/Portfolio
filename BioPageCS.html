<div class="intro">
  <p2> Computer Science is the study of principles and use of computers. From August 2018 to June 2019, I took a Computer Science class at Riley High School.
    Computer Science is one of the most challenging classes that I have ever taken. On this page there are a few links to projects that I have created from the course. </p2>

  <div class="Scratch">
  <h2> Scratch</h2>
  <p2> Scratch is the first programming language that the course introduced us to. Scratch allows the programmer
    to take lines of code, drop, and connect the code to other lines of code.

<div class="AppInventor">
  <h2> App Inventor </h2>
  <p2> App Inventor was the second program that the course worked with. App Inventor allows the programmer
    to take lines of code, drop, and connect the lines to other lines throughout the workspace. App Inventor
    is very similar to the program Scratch.
  </div>
  <div class="Python">
  <h2> Python </h2>
  <p2> Python is a high level programming language. Python is not like Scratch or App Inventor. Instead of having blocks, the programmer must write every single piece of code. </p2>

  <div class="HTML">
    <h2> HTML </h2>
    <p2> The last programming language that we learned was HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used create files to achieve font, color, graphic,
      and hyperlink effects on webpages. This website is the project we were assigned for the HTML unit.
